    The Session Insights API is part of the CAMARA Connectivity Insights family. It extends the capabilities of the Connectivity Insights API by enabling applications to continuously monitor and evaluate their real-time session quality, based on observed KPIs and network operator feedback.

    While the Connectivity Insights API allows applications to query whether a network can meet predefined performance thresholds (e.g., jitter, packet loss, bitrate), the Session Insights API supports the lifecycle of an ongoing session. It allows applications to stream KPI metrics to the network operator, receive dynamic scoring on current session performance, and engage in adaptive optimization strategies.

    # Key Features

    - Create a monitoring session using an existing Application Profile.
    - Send application-level KPIs (e.g., latency, jitter, throughput, loss) to the network operator.
    - Receive a Session Insights Score reflecting network-evaluated session quality.
    - Respond to events and adjust application configuration.
    - Receive notifications and root cause analysis (RCA) when session quality degrades.
    - Request network service improvements using complementary CAMARA APIs (e.g., QualityOnDemand, NetworkAccessManagement).
    - Gracefully terminate the session when monitoring is no longer needed.

    # Application Profile Integration

    This API leverages CAMARA’s [Application Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/ApplicationProfiles) to define threshold criteria for session quality. The Application Profile specifies the application's expected network performance requirements and is referenced when creating a session.

    # Example Use Cases

    ## Wi-Fi Congestion Mitigation
    - Application sets thresholds for latency and packet loss.
    - Session score drops due to congestion, triggering an RCA event.
    - RCA identifies local Wi-Fi congestion; application adjusts QoS policies (e.g., enables WMM) to prioritize traffic.

    ## Access Network Impairment
    - Degraded score attributed to poor signal or congestion in the access network.
    - Application requests service enhancement through APIs like QualityOnDemand or NetworkAccessManagement.

    # Authorization and Authentication

    ## Identifying the [ device | phone number ](*) from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same [ device | phone number ](*) is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

        Create a new session for monitoring application performance and network
        quality. The session can be used to stream KPIs, receive session
        scores, and handle RCA events.

        The session is created under an existing Application Profile, which
        defines the expected performance thresholds and other parameters.

        The operator allocates a sink (HTTP webhook or MQTT topic) for the
        application to send metrics and receive notifications.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one

            The packet delay one-way latency between the customer's device
            and the gateway from the operator's network to other networks. By limiting the delay, the network
            can provide an acceptable level of performance for various services, such as voice calls,
            video streaming, and data.
            The end-to-end or round trip latency will be about two times this value plus the latency not controlled
            by the operator

            packet delay for the 99th percentile of traffic, following ITU Y.1540
            standards. It considers only acknowledged packets in a session, which are
            packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from the recipient (e.g.,
            using TCP). This requirement helps maintain consistent latency, essential
            for real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls, and gaming.

            This field specifies the measured level of data loss during transmission.
            The value is an exponent of 10, so a value of 3 means that up to 10⁻³, or 0.1%, of the
            data packets may be lost. This setting is part of a broader system that categorizes
            different types of network traffic (like phone calls, video streams, or data transfers)
            to ensure they perform reliably on the network.
