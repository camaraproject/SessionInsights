Feature: CAMARA Session Insights API, v0.1.0-rc.1 - Operation getSession
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * The sessionId of an existing HTTP session
    # * The sessionId of an existing MQTT3 session  
    # * The sessionId of an existing MQTT5 session
    # * The sessionId of an existing session with applicationSessionId
    # * The sessionId of sessions created with different device identifier types
    # * Access tokens with appropriate scopes for session retrieval
    #
    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in session-insights.yaml
